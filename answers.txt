What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge combines the commits of a source branch into a target branch, merging their histories. 
A rebase on the other hand rewrites the history so that all the commits start from the end of the initial branch like they were there all along.


What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is the centralized repo that all devs push/pull to and from. It stores all the branches and histories.
